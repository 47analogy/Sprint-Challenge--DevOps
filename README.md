# DevOps and Deployment Assessment
 - In this assessment, you'll be answering some questions on the devops material that we went over.
 - Answers to your written questions should be recorded in *Answers.md*.
 - This assessment is to be worked on alone, but you can use outside resources and reference old repositories.
 - Please refrain from copying and pasting any answers you previously wrote as an answer for a question on this assessment. Try and understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as thorough as possible when explaining something.
 - **Friendly reminder:** Don't fret or get anxious about this assessment. This is a no-pressure assessment that is only going to help show you where you need to brush up on when reviewing. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.
